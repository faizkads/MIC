# Gamelan Predictor
Developed as a final project for Data and AI Ninja Course from Microsoft Imagine Community (MIC).

Gamelan Predictor is a python API built with the background as an art and cultural exhibition helper. The function of the application is to provide a correct classification of a gamelan and its own description from an image input.

The image classification was done by utilizing Microsoft Azure's ML and then deployed as a simple python application calling the service from Azure.
